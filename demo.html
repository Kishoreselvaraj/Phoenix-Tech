    <h1>this is the heading tag </h1>
    <h2>it have h1 to h6 tags</h2>
    we have many tags to create web pages
    based on that.......
    <b>it is bold </b>......
    <bold>This too bold</bold> -This tag cann't working

    ...... <strong>This is also strong </strong>
    ......i-italik or em-emphasize tags are used to make italic words
    <i>Kishore</i><em>Selvaraj</em>
    ..... I wish to make it bold so
    <b><i>Kishore</i><em>Selvaraj</em></b>
    ....for underlining the word we can use <b>u key</b>
    <u>Selvaraj</u>.......Nested tag is <strong><b><u><i>Selvaraj</i></u></b></strong>
    ....The parent of the tag is it's before tag like <b><i>(b)(i) Hi (/i)(/b)</i></b>
    ...Hear b is a parent tag of i(<b>Italic</b>)
    <h3>Aline Atributes</h3>
    <p align="center"><b>Hi this is alignment center</b></p>
    <p align="right"><strong>Hi this is alignment right</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Hi this is alignment left</strong></p>
    <h3>Hyperlink</h3>
    The <b>a</b> tag makes the enclosed text a hyperlink.
    The <b>href</b> attribute specifies the address of the link...Now create a link using <b><em>href</em></b>
    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/vasanth.html"><b><i>This is our web</i></b></a>
    ,........An element can have multiple attributes.
    For example:
    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/vasanth.html" target="_blank" title="Sololearn">Click here</a>
    HTML
    The <b>target</b> attribute specifies how to open the link. With the value "_blank", it will open in a new tab.

    The <b>title</b> attribute specifies the text to appear when the cursor is over the link.
    <h3>Image tag</h3>
    Some elements do not have any text content and are created using a single opening tag.
    For example, to embed an image into the page:
    <img src="/photos/wallpaperflare.com_wallpaper(1).jpg">
    The <b><em>src</em></b> attribute specifies the address of the image we want to embed.
    .........The <b><em>alt</em></b> attribute is used to specify text, which will display if the image fails to load.
    <img src="/photos/alt.jpg" alt="Hacker">

    The <b><i>alt</i></b> text acts as a description for the image.
    It is used in screen readers, as well as search engines, as the description of the image.
    ......<p align="center"><b><i>Size of the image</i></b></p>
    You can also specify a custom size for the image using the <b>height</b>
    and <b>width</b> attributes: If only one dimension is specified, the other will
    adjust according to the aspect ratio of the image.
    <img src="/photos/height  of image.jpg" alt="Image size" width="600">
    ........<b>Size Attributes</b><br>

    The height and width attributes can also take percentage values.
    For example, let's change our image to take half of the page width:
    <img src="/photos/height  of image.jpg" alt="persentage value" width="60%">

    <p align="Center"><b><i>Empty Elements</i></b></p>

    Similar to <b>img</b>, there are other empty elements that are created with
    a single opening tag.

    The <b>hr</b> element is used to create a horizontal line:
    The <b>hr</b> element represents a thematic break between paragraph elements.
    <hr>
    <b><em>Hi I am Creating the web</em></b>
    <hr>
    <b><em>Line Break</em></b><br>


    The <b>br</b> element creates a line break in a paragraph. Without the <br> elements
    , the paragraph would just be rendered in one line.
    <br>
    a<br>
    b<br>
    c<br>
    <b>Image as link</b><br>
    In our previous examples, we have learned how to create hyperlinks
    from text content using the <b>a</b> tag.

    Similarly, almost any element can be made a link.
    For example, we can make an image a link:
    <br><a href="https://www.sololearn.com" target="blank"><img src="/photos/image as  link.jpeg" alt="Sololearn "
            width="300"></a>

    <p align="center"><b><i>Lists</i></b></p>


    There are two types of lists in HTML: <b>ordered</b> and <b>unordered</b>.

    An unordered list is created using the <b>ul</b> tag.
    An unordered list is made of items marked with bullets.
    Now I'm going to create a list

    Next <br>
    <hr><b>This is original unOrder list</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Orenge</li>
        <li>pinaple</li>
    </ul>
    Next <b>This is original Order list</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Apple</li>
        <li>Orenge</li>
        <li>pinaple</li>
    </ol>

    Lists can be <b><i>nested</i></b> inside other lists.
    <ol>
        <li>Science <ul>
                <li>physics</li>
                <li>Chemistry
                <li>BIology</li>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>social</li>
        <li>Tamil</li>
        <li>English</li>
    </ol>
    <p align="center"><b><i>Tables</i></b></p>


    A table is a set of rows and columns.
    HTML supports tables to display tabular data (data that is structured into rows and columns).

    A table is created using the <b>table</b> tag:

    Now we are going to create a table <br>
    <b>table </b>- use to creat a table <br>
    <b>tr</b>-use to create a column <br>
    <b>td</b> -use to create a Row <br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td><b>Name</b></td>
            <td><b>Roll no </b></td>
            <td><b>class</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>kishore-</td>
            <td>71052102044-</td>
            <td> CSE-A-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kannan</td>
            <td>71052102039</td>
            <td>CSE-A</td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    <h4>Border on table</h4>
    Most browsers, by default, include no <b>border</b> for the table.

    We can add a border to see the cells using the border attribute:
    Better and more advanced styling is done using CSS, which
    we will learn in the next module.
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <td><b>Name</b></td>
            <td><b>Roll no </b></td>
            <td><b>class</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>kishore-</td>
            <td>71052102044-</td>
            <td> CSE-A-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kannan</td>
            <td>71052102039</td>
            <td>CSE-A</td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    The <b>th</b> tag is similar to <b>td</b> and is used to add a header to the table.
    The header is a collection of <b>th</b> cells which define the content of the
    cell or row. They are automatically centered in the cell and bold:
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Roll no </th>
            <th>class</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>kishore-</td>
            <td>71052102044-</td>
            <td> CSE-A-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kannan</td>
            <td>71052102039</td>
            <td>CSE-A</td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    Whithout <b>b</b> tag it will be bold<br>
    Another useful attribute is the <b>colspan</b>, which allows a column to span multiple cells.

    For example, let's add a top header cell for our table and make it span 3 columns: The colspan attribute defines
    the number of cells we want it to span.
    <h5>Without using colspan </h5>
    <img src="/without colspan.png" alt="photo">
    <table border="10">
        <tr>
            <th colspan="3">Details</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Roll no </th>
            <th>class</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>kishore-</td>
            <td>71052102044-</td>
            <td> CSE-A-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kannan</td>
            <td>71052102039</td>
            <td>CSE-A</td>

        </tr>
    </table>
    Similar to spanning multiple columns, a cell can also span multiple rows.
    That is achieved using the <b>rowspan</b> attribute.

    For example, let's make a schedule table:
    <table border="10">
        <tr>
            <th colspan="3">Details</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Roll no </th>
            <th>class</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">kishore-</td>
            <td>71052102044-</td>
            <td> CSE-A-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>71052102039</td>
            <td>CSE-A</td>

        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2><i>Page Section</i></h2>

    <b><i>Header</i></b>


    The header of a website is usually a section on the top of the page,
    which can include a logo, a name and other similar elements.
    It is also commonly shared between different pages of a website.

    To define a header section, use the <b>header</b> tag:
    A header can include other HTML elements, such as images, links, etc.
    <header>
        <p align="center"><b><i>Page section</i></b></p>
    </header>

    Image as <b>Header</b>
    <header>
        <img src="/photos/image as  link.jpeg" target="blank">

        <a href="https://www.sololearn.com" target="blank">Link 1</a>
        <a href="https://www.sololearn.com" target="blank">Link 1</a>
    </nav>
    <p align="center"><b><i>Main Contant</i></b></p>
    The main content of the page is defined using the <b>main</b> tag, which can include
    various subsections represented by <b>article</b> and <b>section</b> tags.
    <b>article</b> encloses a block of content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page, such as a blog
    post.
    <p align="center"><b><i>Article and Section</i></b></p>


    <b>section</b> is similar to <b>article</b>, but it is used for grouping together
    a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality, such as a map, or a set of headlines.

    It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading.
    An article element can have different sections, and a section can
    include different articles. It all depends on the structure and content of your page.
    Knowledge is power
    <p align="center"><b><i>Aside</i></b></p>


    The <b>aside</b> element is used to define content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide
    additional information,
    such as related links, or similar articles.

    <p align="center"><b><i>Footer</i></b></p>


    A <b>footer</b> comes at the end of the page. It can contain links, copyright notes, etc.,
    and is created using the <b>footer</b> tag:
    Similar to the header, the footer is commonly shared among different pages of the website.
    Good thinking

    <p align="center"><b><i>div</i></b></p>
    In situations where you simply want to group together
    elements without any specific meaning, you can use the <b>div</b> tag. <b>div</b> is a
    block level element and acts as a container for other elements.
    We will see how to use CSS to style elements in a container in the next module.
    <p align="center">Page Sections</p>


    All of these elements are used to structure the page.
    They do not add any styling or formatting, but represent invisible "boxes", that contain the content and other
    elements of the website.

    It is important to create a correct structure for the page, because search engines and screen readers use it to read
    the content of the page and understand its structure.
    We will also see how to use CSS to style the page in the next module.
    <p align="center"><b><i>Forms</i></b></p>

    <hr>
    <b><em>Forms</em></b> allow users to enter data, which is processed by the website.
    A form contains controls, which include text boxes, buttons, checkboxes, etc.

    Form elements are contained inside a <b>form</b> tag:
    The <b>form</b> element acts as a container for its elements.
    <br><br><b><em>Textbox</em></b>


    The input element allows you to create various form elements.
    It's type attribute defines the type of the element.

    For example, let's make a textbox: <br></br>We will learn how to take the value of the
    textbox with JavaScript later in the course.
    <form>
        <input type="text">
    </form>
    <b><em>Input</em></b>


    The input element supports various types.

    For example:The types define the content with
    the value that the input expects. It makes the keyboard open with the
    corresponding layout, for example, and for the telephone input, it will
    automatically open the numbers.
    Run the code and see how the keyboard layout for the different input types.
    <form>
        <p>Enter your text</p>
        <input type="text"> <br></br>
        <p align="center">Enter your password
            <input type="password"><br></br>
        </p>
        <p align="right">Enter Telaphone number
            <input type="tel"><br></br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">click the button</p>
        <input type="button"><br></br>
        <b><em>Labels</em></b>
    </form>


    The form elements can have labels.
    To give an element a label, you first need
    to add an id attribute to it:
    <form>
        <input type="text" id="Name">
    </form>
    Another way
    <b>Lable</b><br>

    <lable for="num">Enter text</lable>
    <input type="text" id="num"><br>
    <label for="password">Enter pass</label>
    <input type="password" id="password">
    <br>Note that the <b><em>for</em></b> attribute is used to associate the
    label with the id of the form element.
    <h3>Place Holder</h3>
    <form>
        <label for="name">Name: </label>
        <input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Kishore Selvaraj">
    </form>
    <h3>checkboxes</h3>
    <p>the <b>Input </b> can be used for create a
        check boxes</p>
    <form>
        <p><b><em>Select Your Gender</em>
            </b></p>
        <input type="checkbox" id="male">
        <label for="male">Male</label>
        <br></br>
        <input type="checkbox" id="female">
        <label for="female">Female</label>

        <p><b>Radio Buttons</b></p>


        We can also make radio buttons, so that only one of
        them can be checked.

        To make the radio buttons grouped, we must give
        them the same name, using the name attribute:
        <p><b><em>Title</em></b></p>
        <input type="radio" name="title" id="mr">
        <label for="mr">Mr</label> <br></br>
        <input type="radio" name="title" id="mrs">
        <label for="mrs">Mr's</label>
    </form><br>
    <h3>Textarea</h3>


    The input element is used
    to take a single line of text as input.
    To make a multi-line input field, use the
    <b>textarea</b> element:
    <textarea name="Write" id="message" cols="80" rows="4"></textarea>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Drop-down</h3>


    A drop-down lets users select one of multiple options.
    It can be created using the <b>select</b> element: Each option
    in the drop-down is an <b>option</b> element. <br>
    <p><b>Enter your job proffesion</b></p>
    <form>
        <select>
            <option value="">Other</option>
            <option>Software Engg</option>
            <option>Hacker</option>
            <option value="">Developer</option>
        </select>
    </form>
    <br>
    <h3>Buttons</h3>


    Buttons can be create using the <b>button</b> element:
    Clicking the button won't do anything right now.
    We need JavaScript to add functionality to the page.
    We will learn how to do that later in the course.
    <form>
        <button>Click Heare</button>
        <hr>
        Buttons can also be created using the input element: The reset type will
        reset the fields of the form when clicked. <br>
        <input type="text">
        <input type="button" value="send">
        <input type="button" value="reset">
    </form>
    <h4>Special Characters
    </h4>

    In HTML, the characters <,>,",' and & are special
        characters, and are parts of the HTML syntax itself.

        But what if we want to include these special characters in our text?

        For example, we want to include the < and> signs in a paragraph:
            This will break our markup, as the < and> signs are interpreted as an HTML tag.
                Great work <br>
                <img src="/photos/Special Charecter .png" alt="Special charecter" target="blank">
                <br>
                Another commonly used character in HTML is the non-breaking space.
                It is a space that will not break into a new line and is created using & nbsp;.
                <br></br>
                Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together.
                <br></br>
                For example:
                Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from
                truncating spaces in HTML pages.
                If you write 5 spaces in your text, the browser will remove &nbsp; &nbsp; 4 of
                them, but if you use 10 non-breaking spaces, all of them will be preserved.
                Not bad!

                <h3>Commands</h3>


                You can add comments to your HTML code.
                The browser does not display comments, but they help
                document the HTML and add descriptions, reminders, and other notes.

                A comment has to be placed inside <!-- and -->:
                <!-- Your comment goes here -->
                <!-- My HTML learn box it's-->

<p><b>We should perform copywrite option
        on footer only</b></p>
<p align="center"><b><em>Audio
        </em></b></p>


The audio element allows you to add
an audio player to the page.

The audio file is specified using the
src attribute: <br>
Now I'll provide U for my one of the fav song
composed by GV Prakash <br></br>
<audio src="/media/Anbe-Anbe.mp3" controls>Audio not Support</audio>
<p align="center"><b>Looping</b>
</p>


The loop attribute makes the player automatically start to play the track when it reaches the end.
There is also an autoplay attribute that makes the audio start playing automatically, however, most browsers
disable this feature as it is annoying to most users.
You're getting good at this!
<audio src="/media/Merke-Merke-MassTamilan.com.mp3" controls loop>Audio not support</audio>
<p align="center"><b><em>Multiple Sources
</em></b></p>

Different browsers support different formats of audio. To maximize compatibility, the audio element allows 
to add different formats of the same audio track using the <b>source</b> element: 
<p align="center"><b><em>Video</em></b></p>


Playing video is very similar to the audio element:
As you can see, the video element supports the same syntax and the same attributes (controls, autoplay, loop), as the audio element.
Good thinking

You can specify the height and width of the video player:
Irrespective of the size defined, the video will maintain its aspect ratio.
Nailed it.

<video  controls width="80%">
    <source src="/media/Tom and Jeery.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    this video cannot be reached
</video>
<br></br>
<p align="center"><b><em>Embed YouTube Videos
</em></b></p>

Another way to embed videos to a page is using the <b>iframe</b> element.

For example, to embed a YouTube video, find a video you like, click the Share 
button below the video and select the Embed button.
This will give you a code with an <b>iframe</b> element, like this: This will 
display a YouTube player on your page. 
<iframe width="100%" height="50%" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_frames.htm"  frameborder="10" allowfullscreen></iframe>

 <h2>Css</h2>
 we can add any cour to our phara
 We can have multiple declarations in the style rule: The declarations are separated using a semicolon.

 <p style="color:red">Celano is a good boy</p>
<p style="font-size:80px;color:purple">Tamil selvan</p>
Using the style attribute on HTML elements applies the style to that element only.

But what if we wanted to apply the same style to multiple paragraphs?
We would have to copy the same style attribute and define it on all the paragraphs.
This would make a lot of redundant code, and make it very hard to change the style in the future.
